# fitness-page
Landing page of a fitness blog. A rebuilding of a Weebly theme.
Note: I primarily made this to practise my Web Design and to see if I could rebuild the landing page with the same functionality. The images are from the Weebly theme (they are not mine).

The theme is a free theme, "Brooke Anderson - Slick".
Description from Weebly:

About

Slick makes a great first impression with oversized images and bold text. Slick can make any content or messaging look impressive. The navigation keeps visitor attention on the content, while keeping the rest of the site accessible with smooth new scrolling effects and a re-imagined new blog layout only displays just post titles on the blog index page.
